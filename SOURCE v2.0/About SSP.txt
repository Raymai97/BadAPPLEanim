SSP, Simple Sequence Pack, is a new file format developed by Raymai97. It provides better performance and smaller file size.

BadAPPLEanim v2 uses SSP instead of 7 DLLs. Please make sure you copy the ba.ssp into program directory before you run BadAPPLEanim.

PNG-32 SSP used the PNGs from the original Screensaver.
PNG-8 SSP has MUCH smaller file size but silghtly quality decreases.

NOTE:
Due to GITHUB file size limitation, you need to manually download SSP file from my google drive.
